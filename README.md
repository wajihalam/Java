Helsinki - MOOC

[<a href = "https://mooc.fi/en/"> Object Oriented Programming with Java </a>]

This popular course contains 12 weeks (Part 1 and part 2) if Java based projects ranging from "Hello World" to a movie based recommendation system inspired by the Netflix $1M competition. 

Although, this isn't a typical representation of a project, I owe the University of Helsinki a debt of gratitude as they developed an excellent course that gave me a strong fundamentals needed to progress as a software developer.
