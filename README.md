This popular course contains 12 weeks ( <a href = "http://moocfi.github.io/courses/2013/programming-part-1/"> Part 1 </a> and <a href="http://moocfi.github.io/courses/2013/programming-part-2/> part 2 </a> ) if Java based projects ranging from "Hello World" to a movie based recommendation system inspired by the Netflix $1M competition.
